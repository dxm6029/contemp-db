    - db.Matches.find({$where: function{
        if(math.sign(A-B) != -1 || math.sign(A-B) != 0){
            return this.[whatever match info we want]
        }else if(math.sign(B-A) != -1 || math.sign(B-A) != 0){
            return this.[whatever match info we want]

            return "It was a draw"
